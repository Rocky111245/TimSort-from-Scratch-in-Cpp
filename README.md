# TimSort from Scratch in Cpp

## Repository Description

TimSort is one of the highest-efficiency sorting algorithms, implemented in popular languages like Python and Java. This repository aims to recreate the TimSort algorithm from scratch using modern C++ best practices. TimSort is a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort, optimized for real-world data that often contains ordered sequences. Implementations of TimSort are rare, and detailed documentation is scarce. There are not many YouTube tutorials that delve into the intricate details of this algorithm. This project will include thorough documentation, well-structured code, and comprehensive tests to ensure robustness and efficiency. This algorithm has been created using the TimSort documentation first outlined by Tim Peters himself.

## Features

- **Efficient Run Identification**: Detects and utilizes existing ordered subsequences (runs) in the data for optimized sorting.
- **Binary Insertion Sort**: Utilizes binary insertion sort for small runs to ensure efficiency.
- **Optimized Merging**: Implements galloping mode to skip over large sections of data during the merge process.
- **Invariant Maintenance**: Ensures merge invariants are maintained using a stack-based approach.
- **Modern C++ Practices**: Uses smart pointers, STL containers, and template programming for efficient memory management and code reuse.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Includes a suite of tests to verify the correctness and performance of the algorithm.

## Goals

- To provide a high-performance, reliable implementation of TimSort in C++.
- To create educational documentation and code comments that explain the inner workings of the algorithm.
- To follow modern C++ best practices to ensure code clarity, maintainability, and efficiency.
- To fill the gap in available resources and tutorials by providing an in-depth guide and implementation of TimSort.
