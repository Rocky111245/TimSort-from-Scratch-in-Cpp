# TimSort from Scratch in Cpp
 TimSort is one of the highest-efficiency sorting algorithms, implemented in popular languages like Python and Java. This repository aims to recreate the TimSort algorithm from scratch using modern C++ best practices. TimSort is a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort, optimized for real-world data that often contains ordered sequences. Implementations of TimSort are rare, and detailed documentation is scarce. There are not many YouTube tutorials that delve into the intricate details of this algorithm. This project will include thorough documentation, well-structured code, and comprehensive tests to ensure robustness and efficiency. This algorithm has been created using the TimSort documentation first outlined by Tim Peters himself.
